Daboia
======

Daboia is a game of snake, where players can program their own AIs to do their dirty work, and put their state-of-the-art AIs to compete with each other.

The game is written in Java 8. The source code is wrapped inside a NetBeans-project.

# Current Version

As of now, the game consists of a functional local single- and multiplayer - however, the GUI is only *nearly there*, so playing a game with it needs some hacking. A multiplayer is on its way as we speak. The multiplayer is/will be accomplished with client-server technology. Users will mainly connect to each other via a lobby (which is a separate project), but direct connecting will be supported in the future.
